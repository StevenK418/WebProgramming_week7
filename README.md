Developer notes: 
			Deviations from labsheet as follows:
            => Explicit type added for movieName in getmovie getMovieData(movieName:string). 
                => (Code would not compile without this explicit declaration.)
            => Added 'btn-primary' class to search submit button to apply Bootstrap button styling. 
            => Added margin class to the button to align with that shown in the labsheet.
